# neuralNetwork
An implementation of the backpropagation algorithm in C++ using a custom Matrix class. Currently it implements a regression model, here trained on the Boston Housing dataset, and produces the same result with this tutorial on **Tensoflow's** site (regression with **Keras**):
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_regression

Multiclass-softmax classification is to be added.
